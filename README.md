# Pagination

Web Dev Simplified

Pagination is one of the easiest ways to increase the performance of any application you are working on. 
Luckily setting up pagination is actually pretty simple. 
In this video I am going to show you the exact process to set up pagination in your own 
API by going through three distinct steps. 
First we will build out the most simple pagination set up which will get us started with pagination. 
After that we will implement a middleware to take care of pagination for use so we can paginate all of our endpoints easily. 
Lastly, 
we will connect out paginated API to a MongoDB database so we can have a fully functional paginated API with database storage.
